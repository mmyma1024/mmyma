<h2 id="About%20Me">About Me</h2>

<p>I love my hometown, it&#39;s located in northeast China,
where always gets covered in snow and ice when winter comes.
When I was a kid, I spent most of my time playing outside,
and the rest with my computer if the weather was freezing cold.
This is where the journey begun, and hopefully where it ends.</p>

<p>I built this site in order to take documentary about things in my life. So
it&#39;s a pleasure for me, if you decide to spend some time here.</p>

<h2 id="Contents">Contents</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve seen too many site copying posts from the original blogs, with copyright or not, it&#39;s purely a waste of time only just to get a glimpse on it.</p>

<p>What I can do is to write original posts with gratitude to all who gave me inspirations, and share with my friends.</p>

<h2 id="Layout">Layout</h2>

<p>Back in 2002, dad showed me how to use Google on IE explorer.
As I click the url, text always comes out first.
I like sites that runs fast, even using the first web browser &#8220;Lynx&#8221;.
That&#39;s the reason why this site doesn&#39;t have images or javascript.</p>

<p>It looks dumm, but is super fast, and you can get access from anywhere 
whith any broser, and it looks all the same! Isn&#39;t that exciting!</p>
